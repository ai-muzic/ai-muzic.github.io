<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Generating music from text descriptions is a user-friendly mode since the text is a relatively easy interface for user engagement. While some approaches utilize texts to control music audio generation, editing musical elements in generated audio is challenging for users. In contrast, symbolic music offers ease of editing, making it more accessible for users to manipulate specific musical elements. In this paper, we propose MuseCoco, which generates symbolic music from text descriptions with musical attributes as the bridge to break down the task into text-to-attribute understanding and attribute-to-music generation stages. MuseCoCo stands for Music Composition Copilot that empowers musicians to generate music directly from given text descriptions, offering a significant improvement in efficiency compared to creating music entirely from scratch. The system has two main advantages: Firstly, it is data efficient. In the attribute-to-music generation stage, the attributes can be directly extracted from music sequences, making the model training self-supervised. In the text-to-attribute understanding stage, the text is synthesized and refined by ChatGPT based on the defined attribute templates. Secondly, the system can achieve precise control with specific attributes in text descriptions and offers multiple control options through attribute-conditioned or text-conditioned approaches. MuseCoco outperforms baseline systems in terms of musicality, controllability, and overall score by at least 1.27, 1.08, and 1.32 respectively. Besides, there is a notable enhancement of about 20% in objective control accuracy. In addition, we have developed a robust large-scale model with 1.2 billion parameters, showcasing exceptional controllability and musicality.</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> this work focuses on generating symbolic music, which do not contain timbre information. 
    We use MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) to export mp3 files for reference, musicians are encouraged to leverage the .mid files for further timbre improvement.</p>

        <p><b>Text Descriptions:</b> The combination of moderate speed, balanced rhythm, and major key, along with its 4/4 time signature, makes this song a prime representation of the classical style. This music would be best suited for a romantic and elegant sunset on the beach. The song structure is made up of about 15 bars. The music is influenced by Bach. The music is given its sound through piano. The use of a specific pitch range of 3 octaves creates a cohesive and unified sound throughout the musical piece. The track lasts for about 40 seconds.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b></p>
        <p>BART-base: The generated sample from BART demonstrates inadequate control over attributes such as time signature, duration, and octaves. Furthermore, the sample's musicality suffers due to a lack of harmonies, resulting in an incomplete composition.</p>
        <p>GPT-4: The generated music from GPT-4 is controlled well. However, it tends to sound monotonous since the rhythm patterns lack of variations, which is common in most generated music from GPT-4. Furthermore, some counterpoints in the composition, specifically in the 4th and 10th bars, lack well-designed integration, detracting from the overall quality of the piece.</p>
        <p>MuseCoco: The generated music from MuseCoco is controlled precisely. Besides, it has more complex harmonies and more diverse rhythm patterns for a better listening experience.</p>

        <p>BART-base: The generated music solely relies on the piano, which deviates from the consistent instrumentation described in the text. In terms of musicality, the rhythm lacks fluency, with many unexpected rests that disrupt the listening experience.</p>
        <p>GPT-4: While the generated music exhibits precise control, the overall musicality falls short of expectations. The drum pattern deviates from the usual rhythmic sensibility, failing to provide a satisfying rhythmic foundation. Additionally, the note pitches used for the bass are not suitable, resulting in a lack of a cohesive bass line, which is crucial for a complete and well-rounded composition.</p>
        <p>MuseCoco: The generated music demonstrates precise control. The piano effectively carries the melody, while the bass provides a solid foundation with its bass line, enhancing the depth of the composition. The addition of the drums in the middle adds various rhythmic patterns, further enriching the overall musical texture.</p>

        <p>BART-base: The generated music is too long to be corresponding with the text. And it consists of discrete notes and a boring melody, which can not express the classical style of Schubert.</p>
        <p>GPT-4: The pitch range of generated music is limited in only one octave. It simple melody lacks the classical style from Schubert.</p>
        <p>MuseCoco: The generated music is controlled perfectly. It utilizes the piano with a moderate tempo in major, which presents a relaxed style of the 3/4 meter like the Schubert's minuetto.</p>
